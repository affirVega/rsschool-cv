## About me

I'm a software developer with a broad knowledge base in various topics of the IT world. My goal is to create software I would like to use and that anyone can use without much problems.

I help my friends from University a lot. This helps me to learn to explain my code and better understand topics that I study.

I work at repair shop for electronics in my city, I'm solving clients' problems: reinstall windows, disassemble laptops and computers and do various diagnostics.

Some of the projects that I've made:
- University tasks given by a professor (like codewars katas) with couple of large projects (a game, client-server application, application that uses weather api): [Programming](https://github.com/affirVega/Programming)
- A silly game about a bar fight developed with friends in order to learn Godot: [Island Fighter](https://github.com/affirVega/IslandFighter)
- Implemented a simple feature for a cross-patform screenshot tool: [Flameshot commit](https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+up+down+is%3Aclosed)
